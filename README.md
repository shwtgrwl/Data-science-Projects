Real Estate Price Prediction
May 2020 – June 2020

This Data science project walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using bangalore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

1) Python
2) Numpy and pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python flask for http server
7) HTML, CSS and Javascript for UI

In Deployment part:

We will deploy machine learning model to production on amazon aws ec2 instance. We will use nginx web server that will serve http requests. For AWS EC2 we will use ubuntu server on which we will deploy our web application as well as python flask server. Using nginx reverse proxy/api requests will be routed to python flask server running on same machine.
Topics covered in deployment,

1) Technical architecture of this project
2) Setup nginx on windows( dev environment)
3) Chrome javascript debugging tips
Launch EC2 instance on amazon AWS
4) Connect to ec2 instance using ssh( git bash client)
5) Copy code to cloud using Winscp
6) install nginx on ec2
7) nginx setup on ec2
8) install python packages for flask server
